### Soluble Extraction Yield:

Soluble Extraction Yield via. Alan Alder (http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/questions/617573):

    Brew water * tds% / beans

but that would assume that water = final water a better formula would take the absorption rate of beans into account:

    (water - (2.08 x Beans)) * tds% / beans


### TDS from Brix

    TDS = Brix * 0.85 (http://www.coffeed.com/viewtopic.php?t=2489&f=17);
